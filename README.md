# Pre-requisitos

### Instalar Node.js
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Instalar MongoDB Localmente

Primero tienes que crear un directorio `db` para el backup de mongo en caso que el container pare de correr.

```
mkdir db

```

Necesitas tener `Docker` instalado localmente y correr este comando

```
docker run --name mongo -p 27017:27017 -v `pwd`/db:/data/db -d mongo mongod
```

En este punto ya tienes una instancia de MongoDB corriendo localmente.


# Getting started
- Clona el repositorio
```
git clone git@github.com:YoSoyBacan/platform.git
```
- Install dependencies (Server)
```
cd platform
npm install
```

- Install Dependencies (Client)
```
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

# Correr Localmente

### Servidor

```
npm run dev:server
```

### Front-End
Abre otra terminal y entra a `/client`

```
npm start
```



### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.
Below is a list of all the scripts this template has available:


| Npm Script | Description |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start`                   | Does the same as 'npm run serve'. Can be invoked with `npm start`                                 |

#### OLD README.MD

Aqui tenemos un README que vino con el template del proyecto, no aplica en muchos aspectos pero vale la pena leerlo.

# Deploying the app
There are many ways to deploy an Node app, and in general, nothing about the deployment process changes because you're using TypeScript.
In this section, I'll walk you through how to deploy this app to Azure App Service using the extensions available in VS Code because I think it is the easiest and fastest way to get started, as well as the most friendly workflow from a developer's perspective.

## Prerequisites
- **Create a cloud database** -
For local development, running MongoDB on localhost is fine, however once we deploy we need a database with high availability.
The easiest way to achieve this is by using a managed cloud database.
There are many different providers, but the easiest one to get started with is [MongoLab](#mlab).

### <a name="mlab"></a> Create a managed MongoDB with MongoLab
1. Navigate to [MongoLab's Website](https://mlab.com/), sign up for a free account, and then log in.
2. In the **MongoDB Deployments** section, click the **Create New** button.
3. Select any provider (I recommend **Microsoft Azure** as it provides an easier path to upgrading to globally distributed instances later).
4. Select **Sandbox** to keep it free unless you know what you're doing, and hit **Continue**.
5. Select a region (I recommend the region geographically closest to your app's users).
6. Add a name, click **Continue** again, and finally **Submit Order**.
7. Once your new database is created, select it from the **MongoDB Deployments** section.
8. Create a user by selecting the **User** tab, clicking the **Add database user** button, adding a username and password, and then clicking **Create**.
A user account is required to connect to the database, so remember these values because you will need them as part of your connection string.
9. Copy the connection string from the top of the page, it should look like this: `mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds036069.mlab.com:36069/test-asdf`
and replace `<dbUser>` and `<dbpassword>` with the credentials you just created.
Back in your project, open your `.env` file and update `MONGODB_URI` with your new connection string.
    > NOTE! - If you don't have an `.env` file yet, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and follow the comments to update the values in that file.
10. **Success!**
You can test that it works locally by updating `MONGODB_URI_LOCAL` to the same connection string you just updated in `MONGO_URI`.
After rebuilding/serving, the app should work, but users that were previously created in local testing will not exist in the new database!
Don't forget to return the `MONGO_URI_LOCAL` to your local test database (if you so desire).


## Project Structure
The most obvious difference in a TypeScript + Node project is the folder structure.
In a TypeScript project, it's best to have separate _source_  and _distributable_ files.
TypeScript (`.ts`) files live in your `src` folder and after compilation are output as JavaScript (`.js`) in the `dist` folder.
The `test` and `views` folders remain top level as expected.

The full folder structure of this app is explained below:

## Building the project
It is rare for JavaScript projects not to have some kind of build pipeline these days, however Node projects typically have the least amount of build configuration.
Because of this I've tried to keep the build as simple as possible.
If you're concerned about compile time, the main watch task takes ~2s to refresh.

### Configuring TypeScript compilation
TypeScript uses the file `tsconfig.json` to adjust project compile options.
Let's dissect this project's `tsconfig.json`, starting with the `compilerOptions` which details how your project is compiled.
```json
"compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "target": "es6",
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
        "*": [
            "node_modules/*",
            "src/types/*"
        ]
    }
},
```

| `compilerOptions` | Description |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"module": "commonjs"`             | The **output** module type (in your `.js` files). Node uses commonjs, so that is what we use            |
| `"esModuleInterop": true,`         | Allows usage of an alternate module import syntax: `import foo from 'foo';`                            |
| `"target": "es6"`                  | The output language level. Node supports ES6, so we can target that here                               |
| `"noImplicitAny": true`            | Enables a stricter setting which throws errors when something has a default `any` value                |
| `"moduleResolution": "node"`       | TypeScript attempts to mimic Node's module resolution strategy. Read more [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/module-resolution.html#node)                                                                    |
| `"sourceMap": true`                | We want source maps to be output along side our JavaScript. See the [debugging](#debugging) section    |
| `"outDir": "dist"`                 | Location to output `.js` files after compilation                                                        |
| `"baseUrl": "."`                   | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |
| `paths: {...}`                     | Part of configuring module resolution. See [path mapping section](#installing-dts-files-from-definitelytyped) |

The rest of the file define the TypeScript project context.
The project context is basically a set of options that determine which files are compiled when the compiler is invoked with a specific `tsconfig.json`.
In this case, we use the following to define our project context:
```json
"include": [
    "src/**/*"
]
```
`include` takes an array of glob patterns of files to include in the compilation.
This project is fairly simple and all of our .ts files are under the `src` folder.
For more complex setups, you can include an `exclude` array of glob patterns that removes specific files from the set defined with `include`.
There is also a `files` option which takes an array of individual file names which overrides both `include` and `exclude`.


### Running the build
All the different build steps are orchestrated via [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts).
Npm scripts basically allow us to call (and chain) terminal commands via npm.
This is nice because most JavaScript tools have easy to use command line utilities allowing us to not need grunt or gulp to manage our builds.
If you open `package.json`, you will see a `scripts` section with all the different scripts you can call.
To call a script, simply run `npm run <script-name>` from the command line.
You'll notice that npm scripts can call each other which makes it easy to compose complex builds out of simple individual build scripts.

| `watch-debug`             | The same as `watch` but includes the --inspect flag so you can attach a debugger                   |

## Debugging
Debugging TypeScript is exactly like debugging JavaScript with one caveat, you need source maps.

### Source maps
Source maps allow you to drop break points in your TypeScript source code and have that break point be hit by the JavaScript that is being executed at runtime.

> **Note!** - Source maps aren't specific to TypeScript.
Anytime JavaScript is transformed (transpiled, compiled, optimized, minified, etc) you need source maps so that the code that is executed at runtime can be _mapped_ back to the source that generated it.

The best part of source maps is when configured correctly, you don't even know they exist! So let's take a look at how we do that in this project.

#### Configuring source maps
First you need to make sure your `tsconfig.json` has source map generation enabled:
```json
"compilerOptions" {
    "sourceMap": true
}
```
With this option enabled, next to every `.js` file that the TypeScript compiler outputs there will be a `.map.js` file as well.
This `.map.js` file provides the information necessary to map back to the source `.ts` file while debugging.

> **Note!** - It is also possible to generate "inline" source maps using `"inlineSourceMap": true`.
This is more common when writing client side code because some bundlers need inline source maps to preserve the mapping through the bundle.
Because we are writing Node.js code, we don't have to worry about this.

### Using the debugger in VS Code
Debugging is one of the places where VS Code really shines over other editors.
Node.js debugging in VS Code is easy to setup and even easier to use.
This project comes pre-configured with everything you need to get started.

When you hit `F5` in VS Code, it looks for a top level `.vscode` folder with a `launch.json` file.
In this file, you can tell VS Code exactly what you want to do:
```json
{
    "type": "node",
    "request": "attach",
    "name": "Attach by Process ID",
    "processId": "${command:PickProcess}",
    "protocol": "inspector"
}
```
This is mostly identical to the "Node.js: Attach by Process ID" template with one minor change.
We added `"protocol": "inspector"` which tells VS Code that we're using the latest version of Node which uses a new debug protocol.

With this file in place, you can hit `F5` to attach a debugger.
You will probably have multiple node processes running, so you need to find the one that shows `node dist/server.js`.
Now just set your breakpoints and go!

## Testing
For this project, I chose [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as our test framework.
While Mocha is probably more common, Mocha seems to be looking for a new maintainer and setting up TypeScript testing in Jest is wicked simple.

### Install the components
To add TypeScript + Jest support, first install a few npm packages:
```
npm install -D jest ts-jest
```
`jest` is the testing framework itself, and `ts-jest` is just a simple function to make running TypeScript tests a little easier.

### Configure Jest
Jest's configuration lives in `jest.config.js`, so let's open it up and add the following code:
```js
module.exports = {
    globals: {
        'ts-jest': {
            tsConfigFile: 'tsconfig.json'
        }
    },
    moduleFileExtensions: [
        'ts',
        'js'
    ],
    transform: {
        '^.+\\.(ts|tsx)$': './node_modules/ts-jest/preprocessor.js'
    },
    testMatch: [
        '**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)'
    ],
    testEnvironment: 'node'
};
```
Basically we are telling Jest that we want it to consume all files that match the pattern `"**/test/**/*.test.(ts|js)"` (all `.test.ts`/`.test.js` files in the `test` folder), but we want to preprocess the `.ts` files first.
This preprocess step is very flexible, but in our case, we just want to compile our TypeScript to JavaScript using our `tsconfig.json`.
This all happens in memory when you run the tests, so there are no output `.js` test files for you to manage.
